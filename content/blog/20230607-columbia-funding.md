We are pleased to announce that we have entered into an agreement with Columbia University’s [Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory](https://lamont.columbia.edu) to expand access to climate data. For most of Radiant Earth's history, we have focused on expanding access to Earth imagery data, and this collaboration marks a significant expansion of our purview.

With the support of funding and collaborators at Columbia, we will focus on improving access to multidimensional array data formats commonly used in climate science, such as [NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) and [Zarr](https://zarr.dev/). We will work with scientists to publish climate science data on [Source Cooperative](https://source.coop)[^1] and explore ways to share data products that support open, reproducible, and scalable science. By supporting sharing of formats like NetCDF and Zarr, Source will be a useful tool for a wider variety of scientific domains including oceanography, climate modeling, and atmospheric science. 

Additionally, we will integrate Source Cooperative with [Pangeo Forge](https://pangeo-forge.org), a cloud-based tool for automating data extraction, transformation, and loading from archival repositories into the cloud. This integration will streamline the data management process and simplify the workflow for researchers and scientists, providing them with a scalable and reliable option to publish data that they want to share publicly. 

As we embark on this journey, we invite suggestions, feedback, and partnerships from the climate science community and beyond. We encourage you to reach out to us at hello@radiant.earth to get involved and expand access to climate data.
